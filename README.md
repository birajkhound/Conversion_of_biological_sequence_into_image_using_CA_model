# Conversion_of_gene_sequence_into_image_using_CA_model
This experiment is based on a research paper named "Using cellular automata to generate image representation for biological sequences". When I was reading this paper I tried to find the code for this paper but I was unable to find it. So, I tried to code to replicate the paper's idea. For more details please read the README.md file.
